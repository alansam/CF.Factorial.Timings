# CF.Factorial.Timings

## Compare Timings of Different Factorial Calculation Algorithms.

Run timing loops over the following factorial calculator algorirhms to determine which is fastest.

- Iterative.
- Recursive.
- Unrolled Loop.
- Table Lookup.

### Sample Run

```
CF.Factorial.Timings
C Version: 201710
Iterative:
  20!:  2432902008176640000, overflow: false
  CPU Time   =   0.445689 s
Recursive:
  20!:  2432902008176640000, overflow: false
  CPU Time   =   0.629249 s
Unrolled:
  20!:  2432902008176640000, overflow: false
  CPU Time   =   0.141881 s
Tabular:
  20!:  2432902008176640000, overflow: false
  CPU Time   =   0.017959 s
